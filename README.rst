====================================

.. image:: http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg
   :alt: Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.
   :target: http://www.repostatus.org/#wip

NB. Currently this repo just contains miscellaneous source code.  Compiled pdf's are hosted at the `Piecepack Wiki <http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/TrevorLDavis>`_.

Dependencies
------------

1) `Piecepack Grahpics R Package <http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/PiecepackRPackage>`_ installed (and all dependencies installed) plus the project git cloned and all the demo images built (i.e. have ran ``rake all``).  There should be a symbolic link ``configurations`` linking with the ``configurations`` subdirectory in that (cloned) project directory and a symbolic link called ``images/pdf`` linking to the ``pdf/components`` subdirectory in that (cloned) project directory.
2) ``rake``, ``rst2pdf``, ``pandoc``, ``texlive-xetex``, etc. in order to compile the reStructuredText into pretty pdfs.
