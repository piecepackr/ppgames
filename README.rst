``ppgames`` is an R_ package designed to make piecepack_ game diagrams, rulesets, and rulebooks.

.. _piecepack: http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/HomePage
.. _piecepackr: https://github.com/trevorld/piecepackr
.. _R: https://www.r-project.org/

Installation
------------

To install the ``ppgames`` R package use the following commands in R_:

.. code:: r

   install.packages("remotes")
   remotes::install_github("trevorld/piecepackr")
   remotes::install_github("trevorld/ppgames")

If you want to make rulebooks you'll need ``xelatex`` and if you want to make rulesets you'll need a recent version of ``pandoc``.  The following instructions should work on Ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt install texlive-xetex
    sudo apt install cabal-install
    cabal update # add $HOME/.cabal/bin to $PATH
    cabal install pandoc
