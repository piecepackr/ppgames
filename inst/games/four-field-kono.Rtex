\subsection{Description}

Four-Field Kono is a traditional Korean 2-player game. 

\subsection{Setup}

Four-Field Kono is played on a 4 by 4 board made with four tile backs.  Have each player sit across from each other and give each player eight of the coin backs of two suits (i.e. ``astronomical'' versus ``power'' suits or ``dark'' versus ``light'' suits) which they each use to populate the half of the board closest to them so that all squares are occupied at the beginning of the game.  Figure \ref{fig:four-field-kono-starting-diagram} shows the recommended setup.

\subsection{Rules}

A player wins by capturing seven of the other playerâ€™s coins or by depriving the other player of a move.
One player goes first,\footnote{Such as the player owning coins of the highest suit.} after which players alternate turns, moving one of their pieces each
turn. All movements are orthogonal. Captures are made by jumping over a friendly piece
to land on and capture an enemy piece just beyond. Non-capturing moves consist of
moving one space onto an empty square.
