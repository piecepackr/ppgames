\subsection{Description}

Tablut is a historical (hnefa)tafl game played by the SÃ¡mi people until at least the 1700s whose rules were written down by the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus in 1732.

\subsection{Setup}

The game is played by two players one of which controls 16 ``attackers'' and other who controls 8 ``defenders'' plus a ``king''.  There is also a ``castle'' in the center of the board (some modern derivatives also have special corners).  There are multiple schemes that can be used to play this game.  Visualized in Figure \ref{fig:tablut-starting-diagram} is one scheme (``ranks'' versus ``suits'') which gives the attacking player all the coin faces of rank 2,3,4,5 as the attackers and gives the defending player the remaining coin backs as defenders plus a pawn as the king and use 1-4 piecepack dice as the ``castle'' (place the pawn on top of the dice to start the game).\footnote{Another scheme could be for the defenders to be four coin ``aces'' and four coin ``moons'' plus a ``moons'' pawn king versus the remaining coin backs as attackers (with a traditional piecepack this give you black-colored coin defenders plus a black-colored pawn versus non-black-colored coin attackers).}
