ppgames 0.3.1
=============

New features
------------

* ``df_alice_chess``, ``df_chaturaji``, ``df_fide_chess``, ``df_four_seasons_chess``, 
  ``df_shogi``, ``df_ultima``, ``df_xiangqi``  now have a new argument 
  ``has_subpack`` which if ``TRUE`` will provide alternative piecepack "stackpack" diagrams.
* New starting board generators for specific games:
  - ``df_alien_city`` (#8)
  - ``df_desfases``
  - ``df_ice_floe``
  - ``df_plans_of_action``
  - ``df_relativity``
  - ``df_san_andreas``

  - ``df_chess`` for ``df_international_chess``
* Portable Piecepack Notation enhancements:
  - Simplified piece notation now supports playing cards expansion (#30),
    icehouse pieces (#34), (stackpack) subpack,
    dual piecepacks expansion, and hexpack.
* New function ``save_pamphlet`` which is an alternative to ``save_ruleset``
  that saves the ruleset as a trifold pamphlet.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Arguments for starting board generators have been changed.  
  In particular functions no longer takes piecepackr configuration list objects as arguments but 
  instead uses arguments like ``has_matchsticks`` to determine how to customize output.
* Instead of an ``output_dir`` argument both ``save_ruleset`` and ``save_rulebook`` now use
  an ``output`` file argument.
* ``df_fide_chess`` renamed ``df_international_chess``, corresponding ruleset was renamed 
  international-chess.

Bug fixes and minor improvements
--------------------------------

* Fixes bug in starting Ultima diagram generated by ``df_ultima``.
* Fixes bug in color of coin faces in Unicode plaintext diagrams 
  if placed above previously colored piece.
* ``cat_piece`` and ``cat_move`` now has limited support for a "cfg" column 
  "playing_cards_expansion" and "dual_piecepacks_expansion".
* Minor improvements to ``save_ruleset``/``save_rulebook`` output.  
  In particular in addition to the default "letter" paper size can now specify "A4" output.
* Improved rulesets for "american-checkers".
